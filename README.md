# Who am i?
I am Savelyev Yakov, (correct pronunciation in English is Jacob; YakovSava is an abbreviation for his first and last name), I am a middle developer and private contractor for some companies with which I worked. I also have a huge stack of technologies that I can manage, although I often use self-written scripts because optimizing my work is always a priority for me.
In addition to programming, I have skills in system administration and deployment of various scripts and/or automation tools on both Linux and Windows servers. In addition, I often try to provide my applications with some kind of cross-platform functionality; these repositories can serve as examples of this:
- [Data eraser](https://github.com/YakovSava/data_eraser)
- [Automatic copyer to USB (and not only)](https://github.com/YakovSava/auto_copy_to_usb)
Although some repositories are designed specifically for Windows. Here are examples:
- [Comic height calculator](https://github.com/YakovSava/meme_calculator)
- [Comic “strange errors”](https://github.com/YakovSava/comic_mistake)
- [Syslog detector](https://github.com/YakovSava/time_recorder)
In some of my Python repositories, you may have noticed that I partially use C++. This is due to the fact that I am trying to make my programs more cross-platform. In [this repository](https://github.com/YakovSava/data_eraser) you can also see that I even compiled the linux code for an ARM device.

# Why am I so arrogant, I consider myself a middle?
For a long time, in fact, I considered myself a junior, and then it dawned on me that in fact I had a lot of experience, since I worked in several companies. This is how I provide the knowledge that I have (last list update: 11/12/2023):
- Python programming language (experience 1 year 10 months)
- C++ programming language (5 months experience)
- Programming language (or torture) FASM (4 months experience)
- JavaScript programming language (including NodeJS; 7 months experience)
-Git
- Linux
- Nginx
- Apache2
- isc-dhcp-server
- Aiohttp framework
- FastAPI framework
