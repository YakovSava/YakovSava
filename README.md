## Types of versions
If someone is interested in this, then here I will describe the types of versions.
**Pre-Alpha version** - The version before the alpha version. This is often the very first commit in a new repository.
**Alpha version** is an unprepared, raw and unfinished version. The initial stages of development are accompanied by this type of versions
**Alpha test version** - (or Pre-Beta version) version before beta testing, initial testing or bugfix
**Beta version** - Beta version, version of active testing and explicit bugfix
**Pre-Release version** - The version that comes after beta, but before release, frequent bugfixes or cosmetic fixes
**Release version** - The last stage of the product - release. Cosmetic or minor bugfixes.

## Numbered versions
Example of a new version:

*_0_* - Release number
*_0_* - Release type version number
*_3_* - Update (commit) number
*_1_* - The number of minor changes
