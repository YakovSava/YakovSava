## Types of versions
If someone is interested in this, then here I will describe the types of versions.

**Pre-Alpha version** - The version before the alpha version. This is often the very first commit in a new repository.

**Alpha version** is an unprepared, raw and unfinished version. The initial stages of development are accompanied by this type of versions

**Alpha test version** - (or Pre-Beta version) version before beta testing, initial testing or bugfix

**Beta version** - Beta version, version of active testing and explicit bugfix

**Pre-Release version** - The version that comes after beta, but before release, frequent bugfixes or cosmetic fixes

**Release version** - The last stage of the product - release. Cosmetic or minor bugfixes.


## Numbered versions
Example of a new version:

0.0.3.1

Patch 3

*_0_* - Release number

*_0_* - Release type version number

*_3_* - Update (commit) number

*_1_* - The number of minor changes

Patch â„– - The serial number of the commit


## A little about me
Python developer, mainly a backender and I write bots. I'm a freelancer, although I'm trying to find a job.  
My nickname comes from my name and nicknames: Yakov and Savelyi (YakovSava; although Jacob is correct in English) almost all of my works are in the public domain, even those with the most destructive code
