## Types of versions
If someone is interested in this, then here I will describe the types of versions.<br>
**Pre-Alpha version** - The version before the alpha version. This is often the very first commit in a new repository.<br>
**Alpha version** is an unprepared, raw and unfinished version. The initial stages of development are accompanied by this type of versions<br>
**Alpha test version** - (or Pre-Beta version) version before beta testing, initial testing or bugfix<br>
**Beta version** - Beta version, version of active testing and explicit bugfix<br>
**Pre-Release version** - The version that comes after beta, but before release, frequent bugfixes or cosmetic fixes<br>
**Release version** - The last stage of the product - release. Cosmetic or minor bugfixes.


## Numbered versions
Example of a new version:<br>
0.0.3.1<br>
Patch 3<br>
*_0_* - Release number<br>
*_0_* - Release type version number<br>
*_3_* - Update (commit) number<br>
*_1_* - The number of minor changes<br>
Patch â„– - The serial number of the commit


## A little about me
Python developer, mainly a backender and I write bots. I'm a freelancer, although I'm trying to find a job.  
My nickname comes from my name and nicknames: Yakov and Savelyi (YakovSava; although Jacob is correct in English) almost all of my works are in the public domain, even those with the most destructive code
